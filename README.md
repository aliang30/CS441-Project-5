Project 5 Description (README)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For this project we created a car game; the objective of the game is to dodge the obstacles in your path without losing your lives. You are given three lives and if you get hit three times by cones, you will be transitioned to the game over screen where you will find your score. We also created an instruction screen which you can access in the main menu. Once hit play, you will be taken to a screen where you are given the option to choose one vehicle that can be used in the game (Red Audi or Black Viper). We utilized multiple activities with numerous buttons that take you to specific activity screens.
